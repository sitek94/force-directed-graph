# Force-Directed Graph

This project is based on [Force-Directed Graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph) by [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock).

My main goal was to make it work in a _sveltish_ way and to add a little bit of typesafety.

## Scripts

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# Create a production version of your app
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

## Bootstrapped with create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [create-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).
